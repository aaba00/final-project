# class 5 map, updated from class 4

Map of nyc that displays clusters of 311 reports related to people experiencing homelessness, filtered by year. The slider updates the filter on the data, allowing for a different year of data to be displayed on the map.

This map is one stage of a larger idea. Eventually, I hope to visualize homelessness reports and some measure of local real estate values. While homelessness is usually more policed in high-income areas, the pandemic presented major shifts in homelessness (including, but not limited to, the type of people that become homeless) and real estate values. This map is meant to capture the evolution of these two phenomena using the time period 2019-2022.
