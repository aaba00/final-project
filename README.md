# environmental justice + local law 97

A map that visualizes all multifamily residential buildings that are subject to New York City's Local Law 97 (2019). Buildings are classified by their relative emissions compared to similar buildings nationally: high (at least 10% more intense energy use), low (at least 10% less intense energy use), and mid-range (between 10% more and 10% less). 

Users can toggle between a view of all buildings at once (buildings are clustered by proximity and displayed using dynamically-styled pie charts) or specific categories of buildings, by energy use.

The code for the dynamic pie-chart clusters was adapted from https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/cluster-html/.

The pie-chart code was altered to connect to Bootstrap buttons that are handled using code from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19463651/how-to-change-the-class-of-an-html-button-at-runtime-on-its-click-event
